## 🔄 **Core System Workflow**

### **1. System Initialization**
```
Application Startup → Database Connection → ML Model Loading → WebSocket Server → Ready State
```

**Process:**
- FastAPI application starts up
- MongoDB connection established
- Pre-trained ML model loaded into memory
- WebSocket server initialized for real-time updates
- System enters ready state, waiting for requests

---

### **2. Room Setup Workflow**
```
Create Room → Configure Preferences → Set AI Settings → Initialize Lights → Ready for Automation
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. **Room Creation** (`POST /rooms/`)
   - User provides room name and type
   - System creates room with default preferences
   - Room ID generated and stored in database

2. **Preference Configuration** (`PATCH /rooms/{room_id}/`)
   - AI automation enabled/disabled
   - Auto-brightness settings configured
   - Motion sensitivity levels set (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
   - Time-based preferences established

3. **Light Initialization**
   - Default light status: OFF
   - Brightness level: 0%
   - Source: MANUAL (initial state)

---

### **3. Motion Detection & AI Decision Workflow**
```
Motion Detected → Data Collection → AI Prediction → Light Control → Database Storage → Real-time Update
```

**Detailed Process:**

#### **Step 1: Motion Event Detection**
- Motion sensor detects movement in room
- Event sent to `POST /motion/` endpoint
- System captures:
  - Room identifier
  - Motion status (true/false)
  - Timestamp
  - Sensor confidence level

#### **Step 2: AI Data Preparation**
- Extract features from motion event:
  - Time of day (0-23 hours)
  - Day of week (0-6, Monday=0)
  - Recent motion history (last 5 events)
  - Room-specific patterns

#### **Step 3: ML Model Prediction**
- Input data formatted for ML model
- Model runs prediction in background thread
- Returns confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
- Decision threshold: >0.5 = Light ON, ≤0.5 = Light OFF

#### **Step 4: Light Control Decision**
- AI prediction determines light action
- System checks room preferences:
  - Is AI enabled for this room?
  - What's the preferred brightness level?
  - Any time-based restrictions?

#### **Step 5: Light State Update**
- Light status updated in database
- Brightness level set based on preferences
- Source marked as "AI" (not manual)
- Timestamp recorded

#### **Step 6: Real-time Broadcasting**
- WebSocket message sent to all connected clients
- Mobile apps, web interfaces receive immediate updates
- Light status changes reflected in real-time

---

### **4. Light Control Workflow**
```
User Request → Validation → State Change → Database Update → Real-time Broadcast → Response
```

**Control Methods:**

#### **Manual Control** (`PUT /lights/{room_id}/`)
- User sets specific light status and brightness
- Source marked as "MANUAL"
- Immediate execution

#### **Toggle Control** (`POST /lights/{room_id}/toggle/`)
- Switches light between ON/OFF states
- Maintains current brightness when turning ON
- Quick control for simple operations

#### **Brightness Control** (`POST /lights/{room_id}/brightness/`)
- Sets specific brightness level (0-100%)
- Automatically turns light ON if brightness > 0
- Smooth brightness adjustment

#### **Dimming Control** (`POST /lights/{room_id}/dim/`)
- Gradual brightness reduction over time
- Configurable duration (default: 30 seconds)
- Smooth transition for ambient lighting

---

### **5. Scheduling Workflow**
```
Schedule Creation → Time Monitoring → Event Trigger → Light Control → Logging
```

**Process Flow:**

1. **Schedule Setup** (`POST /schedule/`)
   - User defines lighting schedule
   - Room, time, action, repeat pattern specified
   - Schedule stored in database

2. **Schedule Monitoring**
   - Background process monitors current time
   - Checks for matching schedules
   - Triggers actions at specified times

3. **Schedule Execution**
   - Light control command sent
   - Source marked as "SCHEDULE"
   - Event logged for analytics

4. **Repeat Patterns**
   - **ONCE**: Single execution
   - **DAILY**: Every day at same time
   - **WEEKLY**: Same day each week
   - **MONTHLY**: Same date each month

---

### **6. AI Learning & Improvement Workflow**
```
Data Collection → Pattern Analysis → Model Training → Accuracy Improvement → Better Predictions
```

**Learning Process:**

1. **Data Accumulation**
   - Motion events stored with timestamps
   - Light decisions recorded
   - User feedback collected

2. **Pattern Recognition**

   - Model parameters adjusted
   - Performance metrics monitored

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Better predictions for similar situations
   - Reduced false positives/negatives
   - More energy-efficient lighting
